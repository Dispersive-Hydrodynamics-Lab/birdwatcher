In the viscous fluid conduit system we can observe a variety of structures
including solitons, dispersive shock waves, and other coherent structures. This
system is characterized by its formation of a deformable, fluid-filled pipe that
results from pumping a buoyant, viscous interior fluid into a dense, more
viscous exterior fluid.  Conduits are observed experimentally as a vertical
column where the interior fluid is dyed black for contrast with the colorless
exterior fluid. This work will examine the possibility of a soliton gas forming
from the regularized formation of discrete solitons.

A soliton gas in a one-dimensional system can be characterized by the fact that
its solitons are Poisson-distributed in time, so the body of this work is to
determine if our initial set of solitons (which are uniform in spacing with
uniform-distributed amplitudes) eventually converge to being
Poisson-distributed. Since we are dealing with a continuous-time system we also
leverage the Poisson-point process model which assumes continuous-time.  This
model's properties are instrumental in the resulting analysis.

This initial work is done with high-performance numerical simulations, with
planned extension to acquiring experimental data in the next few months.
